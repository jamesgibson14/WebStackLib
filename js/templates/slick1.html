      <h2>Demonstrates:</h2>
      <p>
          The container which the grid is being created in needs to be in the DOM and participate in layout
          (can be 'visibility:hidden' but not 'display:none') in order for SlickGrid to be able to make certain
          measurements and initialize event listeners.  Normally, this is done when a SlickGrid instance is 
          being created.  Optionally, you can defer the initialization until the above condition is met and call
          the <b>grid.init()</b> method explicitly.  To use explicit initialization, set the <b>explicitInitialization</b>
          option to true.
          <br/><br/>
          This example demonstrates creating a SlickGrid inside a detached element and calling <b>init()</b> explicitly
          when the element is added to the DOM.
