WebStackLib
===========

This is a lazy-loading MVC Javascript app setup up and ready to go with Backbone, Requirejs, jquery. 
It is meant for a secure internal network and can connect directly to the database via ActiveX ADODB.
It does not need a web server to run.
I use as a .hta windows application.  
Disclaimer: There are various security issues that need to be addressed so use at your own risk.
